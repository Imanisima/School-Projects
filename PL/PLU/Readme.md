### Assignment

Design a prototype that will provide an interface which will allow the produce manager of a grocery store to easily punch in the number and or name of a given fruit or vegetable.

### Context
```In Albertsons, my daughter saw rambutans and decided to buy six to take to a party. She used the self-checkout, but couldn't find rambutans listed. A cashier saw her struggling and came over to help. After a short conversation, the cashier punched in the PLU for something else entirely, and told my daughter that was was the real name of the fruit, even though the picture was entirely different and the price was much lower. My daughter paid as she was told and left, but felt bad about it.```
