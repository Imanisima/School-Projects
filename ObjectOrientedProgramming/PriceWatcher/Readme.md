## CLASS PROJECT FROM OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING :computer:

A PRICE WATCHER application that will help you figure out the best time to buy something by watching fluctuating online prices.

**PROJECT:** develop a price tracking application, named
Price Watcher, in a series of assignments. The application
will help a user to figure out the best time to buy something by
watching over fluctuating online prices. It behaves like Amazon's wish
list (www.amazon.com). You will start with a very simple application
and refine it to an ultimate version in several iterations.

IDEA: In this assignment, you are to write the first version of the Price
Watcher application that tracks "simulated" prices of a single, fixed
item. 

    Welcome to Price Watcher!
