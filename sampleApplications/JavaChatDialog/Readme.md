## JavaChat Dialog :computer:

# One-sided chatroom simulator
When the user types in a message and then clicks ``` send ``` while not "connected" to a server, an error message will pop up and the window pane will turn red.

Once the user clicks the ``` connect ``` button, the window pane color will return to its orginal color, and messages will be allowed to be sent (one-sided of course! :wink:).

To disable messages, click ``` disconnect ```.
