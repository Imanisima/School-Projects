LAB 4

In the previous lab, a BST was used to find the anagrams of a word. However, to improve the running time of the program we have implemented the hash table function.

Requirements:
  - Use chaining to solve collisions
  - Determine the average number of comparisons required
  - Compute the table's load factor
  
Note:
  - The choice of table size and hashing function has a large impact in the number of collisions
  - There are 354,984 English words within words.txt
  - Think of a word in the English language as a base-26 number
