Implement the following operations for a binary search tree:
* Inorder traversal using a stack instead of recursion
* Iterative version of the search operation
* Build a balanced binary search tree given a sorted array as input WITHOUT using insert operation
* Extract elements in a binary tree into a sorted array
* Print the elements in a binary tree by depth
